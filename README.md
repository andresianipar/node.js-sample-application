# Node.js Sample Code
This repository serves as documentation for the code I wrote while learning Node.js. The sample code is taken from [Beginning Node.js 1st ed. Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Node-js-Basarat-Syed/dp/1484201884/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1CGUVZAJ53P9I&keywords=beginning+node.js&qid=1580983908&sprefix=beginning+no%2Caps%2C464&sr=8-1).
